# High-Level Design Document - MLOps AI Financial Application

## 1. System Overview

The MLOps AI Financial Application is a comprehensive platform designed for financial market analysis, portfolio optimization, and investment decision-making. The system integrates multiple machine learning models to provide real-time stock predictions, sentiment analysis of market news, and portfolio optimization recommendations.

The application follows a microservices architecture, with each component containerized using Docker and orchestrated through Docker Compose. This design enables independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance of each service while ensuring seamless communication between components.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with four primary components:

### 2.1 Data Ingestion Layer

- Collects stock price data from external financial APIs
- Processes and stores data in MongoDB for use by model inference services
- Utilizes Apache Airflow for orchestrating data collection workflows

### 2.2 Model Inference Layer

- Consists of three specialized prediction services:
  - **Portfolio Optimization:** Generates optimal asset allocation recommendations
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzes financial news to determine market sentiment
  - **Stock Prediction:** Forecasts future stock prices using time-series models

### 2.3 Web Application Layer

- Provides a user interface for visualizing predictions and portfolio recommendations
- Exposes RESTful APIs for accessing model predictions and financial data
- Integrates data from all underlying services for a unified user experience

### 2.4 Monitoring Layer

- Monitors system performance and model accuracy
- Tracks resource utilization across all services
- Provides dashboards for visualizing system health metrics

## 3. Component Interactions

The system components interact through the following flow:

1. The Data Ingestion service collects daily stock data using Apache Airflow and stores it in MongoDB
2. Model Inference services retrieve necessary data from MongoDB to generate predictions
3. The Web Application queries both the raw data and model predictions to present insights to users
4. The Monitoring system collects metrics from all components to ensure system reliability

## 4. Design Decisions and Rationale

### 4.1 Microservices Architecture

The system employs a microservices architecture to enable:

- **Independent Scaling:** Each service can be scaled based on its specific resource requirements
- **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use the most appropriate frameworks and technologies
- **Fault Isolation:** Issues in one service do not necessarily affect the entire system
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Services can be updated independently without system-wide downtime

### 4.2 Containerization with Docker

Docker containers were chosen to:

- Ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments
- Simplify deployment and scaling of the application
- Provide isolation between services to avoid dependency conflicts
- Enable rapid onboarding of new developers with consistent environments

### 4.3 Data Storage with MongoDB

MongoDB was selected as the primary database because:

- Its document-oriented structure is well-suited for storing heterogeneous financial data
- Schema flexibility accommodates evolving data requirements
- High performance for read operations supports real-time data access
- Horizontal scaling capabilities support future growth

### 4.4 Model Selection Approach

The ML models were selected based on:

- **Portfolio Optimization:** Modern portfolio theory principles for optimal asset allocation
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Transformer-based NLP models for accurate text analysis
- **Stock Prediction:** LSTM/GRU neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies in time-series data

## 5. Scalability and Performance Considerations

The system is designed with the following scalability features:

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Each microservice can be independently scaled based on load
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks are processed asynchronously to maintain responsiveness
- **Caching Strategies:** Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce database load
- **Efficient Data Access Patterns:** Services retrieve only the data they need, minimizing network traffic

## 6. Security Design

The application implements several security measures:

- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables
- **API Authentication:** All service-to-service communication requires authentication
- **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks

## 7. Future Extensibility

The system is designed to accommodate future enhancements:

- Additional financial instruments beyond the current stock selection
- More sophisticated ML models as research progresses
- Integration with additional data sources for enhanced prediction accuracy
- Extended monitoring capabilities for more granular performance analysis

## 8. Deployment Model

The application uses a containerized deployment model with Docker Compose, enabling:

- Simple local development setup
- Straightforward deployment to various cloud providers
- Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- Easy configuration management through environment variables

This design provides a scalable, maintainable architecture that can evolve with changing business requirements and technological advancements in the financial analytics domain.
