## Getting Started

### Accessing the Platform

1. After deploying the application, access it by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
2. You will be greeted with a welcome screen that introduces the main features of StockInsight.

### Searching for Stocks

1. Use the search bar at the top of the page to find stocks by company name or ticker symbol.
2. As you type, a dropdown will appear showing matching stocks.
3. Click on a stock from the results to select it and load its data.
4. Alternatively, clicking on the search field without typing will show the complete list of available stocks.

## Main Dashboard

Once you select a stock, the dashboard displays several panels with key information:

### Stock Overview

The top section displays:

- Company name and ticker symbol
- Current stock price
- Daily price change (amount and percentage)
- Visual indicator (green for positive change, red for negative change)

### Price History Chart

- Displays historical price data for the selected stock
- Use the time filter buttons (1W, 1M, 3M) to adjust the displayed time period
- Hover over the chart to see specific price values for each date

## Analysis Panels

### Portfolio Allocation

This panel shows the optimal investment allocation across multiple stocks, calculated using Modern Portfolio Theory.

**Features:**

- Pie chart visualizing the recommended portfolio allocation
- List of individual stocks with their percentage allocations
- Portfolio metrics including Sharpe ratio, expected return, and volatility

**How to interpret:**

- Larger slices represent stocks with higher recommended allocation
- The portfolio is optimized to maximize the Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted return)
- Click the expand button to view detailed metrics in a modal window

### Sentiment Analysis

This panel analyzes market sentiment towards the selected stock based on financial news.

**Features:**

- Bar chart showing sentiment scores over time
- Color-coded bars (green for positive, red for negative, gray for neutral)

**How to interpret:**

- Sentiment scores range from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive)
- Higher positive scores indicate favorable market sentiment
- Consistent positive sentiment may correlate with future price increases
- Click the expand button for a more detailed view

### Price Prediction

This panel provides forecasts of future stock prices based on historical patterns.

**Features:**

- Line chart showing both historical prices and predicted future prices
- Historical data shown in blue, predictions in green with a dashed line

**How to interpret:**

- The prediction shows the expected price trend for the next 14 days
- The model uses LSTM neural networks to generate predictions
- These predictions should be considered as one of many factors in investment decisions
- Click the expand button for an expanded view with more historical context

## Model Information

Each analysis panel includes an information icon (â“˜) that provides details about the underlying model:

- **Portfolio Optimization**: Uses Modern Portfolio Theory with risk optimization based on historical variance-covariance matrices to maximize the Sharpe ratio.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs natural language processing with BERT-based models trained on financial news and social media data, with scores ranging from -1 to +1.

- **Price Prediction**: Utilizes LSTM neural networks and linear regression with technical indicators, trained on historical data and incorporating sentiment analysis.

## Best Practices

1. **Multiple Stock Analysis**: Compare predictions and sentiment across different stocks to identify potential investment opportunities.

2. **Time Frame Consideration**: Use different time frames in the price history chart to understand both short-term and long-term trends.

3. **Comprehensive Decision-Making**: Consider all three analysis components (portfolio allocation, sentiment, and price prediction) together when making investment decisions.

4. **Regular Updates**: Check back frequently as data is updated daily with the latest market information.

## Important Notes

- All predictions and analyses are generated by machine learning models and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
- Past performance is not indicative of future results.
- Financial markets are influenced by numerous factors that may not be captured by these models.
- Always conduct additional research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
